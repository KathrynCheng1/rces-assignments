# Assessing the Effects of Participant Activity and Environmental Parameters on PM2.5 Exposure to Women in the Bono East Region, Ghana

## Introduction & Motivation: 
Household air pollution (HAP) from the burning of solid fuels (e.g., wood, crop residues, dung, coal) indoors is associated with 3.8 million deaths annually. Worldwide, around 2.8 billion people are exposed to high levels of cooking-related HAP. Airborne fine particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5) is an established environmental health risk factor to measure the toxicity of HAP. PM2.5 is hazardous because it is small enough to deposit deep in the lungs. Participants wear a personal monitoring device, Ultrasonic Personal Air Sampler (UPAS), to detect particulate matter exposure. The UPAS contains a size-selective inlet, in the form of a cyclone, to gravitationally filter out particles larger than 2.5 μm, so that only PM2.5 are collected onto the air filter. However, we detect particles larger than PM2.5 on the air filter, meaning the cyclone has not filtered out particles larger than 2.5 μm properly. 

## Research Objectives: 
The purpose of this project is to determine why the cyclone is failing and assess what parameters affect PM2.5 exposure. First, I will determine why the cyclone is failing by comparing the PM2.5 gravimetric correction ratio to participant activity of when the cyclone did not fail and when the cyclone did fail. I will calculate the gravimetric correction ratio using equation 1: 
[1]                     r_GC=  (m_post- m_pre- m_(field blank))/(〖C[〖PM〗_2.50]〗_UPAS  × mv)
Where m_post is the mass of the air filter before deployment (μg), m_pre is the mass of the air filter after deployment, m_(field blank) is the average weight of the field blank filter, mv is the average volume of air (m^3) and 〖C[〖PM〗_2.50]_UPAS is the average concentration of PM2.5 from the UPAS. 
Next, I will explore how different environmental parameters, including temperature and relative humidity, affect the distribution of PM2.5 on the UPAS filters. 

## Datasets: 
I will have datasets from UPAS’s collected from October 2024 (40 UPAS’s). The information I will use from a UPAS dataset includes PM2.5 concentrations, nephelometer data, temperature, and relative humidity. The nephelometer data is used to determine the participant’s wearing compliance to elucidate participant activity. The active pumping interval is 48 hours with data collected every 30 seconds during the day and every 15 minutes at night (10pm-4am). I will use a dataset from October 2021 (40 UPAS’s), where we know the cyclone did not fail and calculate the gravimetric correction ratio for October 2021 UPAS’s and compare these gravimetric correction ratios to October 2024 gravimetric correction ratios.

## Planned Analysis: 
I will create a histogram of particle sizes to determine the size distribution of particles on the air filters. Additionally, I will do a time series analysis of the gravimetric correction ratio of when the cyclone worked versus when the cyclone started to fail with participant activity (e.g., how long the participant wore the UPAS) to determine how participant activity impacts particle distribution. Finally, I will graph the different environmental parameters (e.g., temperature and relative humidity) with particle size to determine how different environmental parameters affect particle size.  

## Expected Outcomes:
I hypothesize that increased participant activity will be associated with increased larger particles on the air filter and cyclone failure. I also hypothesize that increased temperatures and relative humidity will increase the deposition of PM2.5 and larger particles.
